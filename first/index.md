CiberNetics is a competition designed to introduce beginners to Red VS Blue Team competitions.

In this competition team of two people will compete with each other with the goal of gathering 
all the flags in the other team's server, while protecting their own flag. 

**Ciber Netics**
Will start from May 29 and will last for as long as I can make it last.
2 Teams with 2 player in each team will compete with each other for one hour a day.
Those teams that can make it will compete other can be a spectator, or do their own thing
The teams will be rotate until everyone has a chance to work one a new person at least two times
Once they have worked with someone at least once, each player will have their own score count
If everything goes well, then high scoring player will be paired with low scoring player, and second high scoring player will be paired with second low scoring player and final bracket will be announced.
**Points**
If you have more flags then you win
If you get a one hidden super flag then even if the other teams has more flags, the team with the hidden super flag wins
The super secret flag will be known to the teams, and they need to do their best to protect it. Other flag location, and how to get them will not be disclosed.
**Notes**
If the teams are stuck and don't know what they are doing I will poke into their server and exploit stuffs, to keep the competition fun.
