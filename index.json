Q and A Do you know what we are doing yet because I have no clue? You will be given a SSH key, two server IP’s one where you ssh into and another that you are supposed to attack You will need to protect your server while also attacking the other IP Other team will get your server IP, and they will be attacking your server while trying to protect their server I have basic Linux knowledge but never done one of these before, is that a problem? It’s okay if you are beginner, we are here to learn If you guys are stuck i will come by and aid both teams I take it defending is just setting up permissions correctly? and attacking is trying to exploit bad permissions Yup, and see if there are any vulnerable services running, and patching it What if you delete all services? There will a script in place to check your service, your points will be deducted based on the amount of time the service is down What if I accidentally delete the service? You will need to re-configure the service and get it to how it was before. So make sure you don’t delete any services that’s necessary How will I know those services? You will be given the list of services that needs to be up. How do I even attack the server? If you have no idea how to attack the server, I will have a quick video of how to get into a server. How long will it last for? One hour or until one of the server is completely hacked. How will the server be completely hacked? If the other person get’s the biggest flag assigned to you. What are the flags? There will be important informations in your server that you need to protect, and one of them will be of the highest value. What if I remove the flag in my server so that other can’t get it? If the flag is removed is the same thing as other team getting it. I can ssh into the server after it’s over and see if the flag are still there. Ways to claim other teams flag is by removing them, or copying it and sending it to me and telling me where you found it. How would I know if it’s a flag? It will be in a unique format, and you will know once you see it. I will tell you the flag that has the highest value. Will there be malware on the system? Yes, maybe, probably, who knows How will we protect the malware from pivoting to our system? There will only be beacons on the server, which doesn’t really have any power to pivot to your system. How do we hack? Will be HTB style? CTF style? There’s no limitation or restriction on how you will attack, you can use tools like metaspolit to see if you can find any old vuln services already running on the system. You can craft your own script. First thing I would recommend everyone doing is doing a quick nmap scan. There will probably be vulnerable services or vulnerable webservers That you can exploit and get reverse shells There might even be some binary exploitation that you can leverage for your attack ","date":"2022-05-23","objectID":"/first/:3:0","tags":["Competition"],"title":"CiberNetics","uri":"/first/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Phalerovia Phalerovia is a small team of people, interested in Technology, Cyber Security, Programming and more.
